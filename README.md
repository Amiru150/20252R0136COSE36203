# COSE36203 Term Project Repository

This repository contains my implementation of the YouTube video category classification model using TF-IDF and an improved Multilingual BERT approach.  
It includes the final code, dataset, and experiment results used for the team project.

## How to Run
1. Open the code in Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset (youtube_videos_big.csv)  
3. Run all cells from top to bottom  
## Model Overview
- Baseline: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression  
- Improved Model: Multilingual BERT with oversampling
